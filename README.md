I used **minimax algorithm**, assigning 1 to the outcome for X's winning and -1 to O's winning and 0 for draws.

Player X attempts to maximize while Player O attempts to minimize and the computer plays the opposite side.


Assuming you always make the ideal move, it is impossible to win.

Note: optimizations are possible, potentially by alpha-beta pruning.
